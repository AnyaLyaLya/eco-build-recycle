# Landing Page for Construction Waste Removal and Recycling Service

This project is a landing page developed using React with SCSS, TypeScript, `classnames`, and `swiper`. The landing page aims to showcase a construction waste removal and recycling service, emphasizing professionalism and the company's ecological focus.

## Key Features

- **Design:** The designed layout effectively conveys information about the service while highlighting professionalism and the company's environmental commitment.

- **Navigation:** A user-friendly navigation menu is available for smaller screens, accessible through a burger menu, ensuring easy access to all sections of the landing page.

- **Swiper:** The `swiper` library is utilized to create a swiper/slider, allowing content to be displayed as slides.

- **Feedback Form:** The landing page includes a feedback form. After successful form submission, a modal window appears, automatically disappearing after 5 seconds or upon clicking a button.

- **Accordion:** An accordion component is implemented with three individual blocks. Clicking on a block expands and collapses the content, providing additional information to users as needed.
